              Tell a story that begins with a web page you build and ends in a location on Google Maps or on YouTube, with a link to the starting point. Your story may be fiction or nonfiction. Traverse at least three platforms in between, leveraging the strengths of each to help your reader visualize the story.

              For this project, we’ll make use of Airtable’s API to design and build a website to display and interact with your peer’s content. Keep in mind that you’re not designing a fixed, unchanging website: you’re designing a system that can expand or contract to show this collection as it changes. Your final website must be responsive, so design mobile FIRST. Then design for desktop.
